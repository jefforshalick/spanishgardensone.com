<!-- ## Welcome to an oasis in the desert {.text-center} -->

Welcome to an oasis in the desert. We are a small community of 76 individually owned units with 2 pools, 4 fountains, and plenty of green grass, foliage, and trees to go around. We share our entrance and exit with our sister property Spanish Gardens North.

On this site, you can find information about our property, answers to frequently asked questions, notices about our upcoming meetings, links out to some other tools we use, and ways to contact the board and management.

Whether you're an owner, tenant, or prospective buyer, welcome.
